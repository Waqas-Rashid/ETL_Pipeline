Grassy Litter Box Idea,1,tt7awf,Bunnies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bunnies/comments/tt7awf/grassy_litter_box_idea/,0,"Hey everybunny! (haha) I was toying with the idea of growing grass indoors over a large area encompassing the litter box corner. To prevent digging, cover the entire thing with a paw-friendly grate suitable for crapballs to pass. Basically a massive extremely low maintenance litter box with food production. :D

My 10 week old bunny free roams an entire bedroom which she has completely to herself, would be easy to implement. \^\^

HELP! Any tips…,1,tthpss,Bunnies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bunnies/comments/tthpss/help_any_tips/,1,My 5month old bunny suddenly stopped eating her hay and won’t eat pellets either but will still eat her vegetables since yesterday morning. We took her to the vet and received critical care food so we have been trying to syringe feed her since last night. She will eat some but not as much as we would like. I am scared it will turn into full blown stasis if we don’t figure something to help her out. Does anyone have any vegetables in mind that might be good source of fiber to help her gut kick start? We maybe taking her to the Emergency vet again tomorrow if she won’t eat still… our hearts are breaking in fear of losing our baby.,1648785525.0

still grieving over the loss of my pet bunny,68,tstgiy,Bunnies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bunnies/comments/tstgiy/still_grieving_over_the_loss_of_my_pet_bunny/,15,"TW: mentions of death (specifically)

i'm 19 years old, female. my rabbit, mini rex rabbit, passed away on February 15th, last month. please skip this paragraph if you do not want the backstory. i received him on April 1st of 2021, when he was barely 3 months old. i knew absolutely nothing about rabbits, but the owner needed him gone since he was the smallest of the litter and he kept getting bullied, to the point where a bite was gone from his ear from the bullying. the owner practically neglected him because the day i brought him home, the bite on his ear still looked fresh, and very much untreated. right then and there i had dropped $350 on food, bedding, litter box, toys, hay, everything a bunny could need according to google, and the little information my dad knew about outdoor rabbits. i googled an animal(/bunny) safe Neosporin to apply to his ear to heal it. i knew we were gonna be best friends forever. unfortunately, just one month later in May, i noticed he was bleeding from the mouth and almost had a heart attack rushing him to the vet. turns out he had bitten into an electrical cord and it blew up his mouth, permanently damaging his bottom right tooth (he didn't have it for the rest of his life) and severely burned his mouth. i spent another $400 on the visit and his shots and new food, treatment, and whatever else it had been. then and there i called my boyfriend and we decided to name him Maximilian because he was already costing me a million dollars. a small fortune, anyway, to then 18 year old me making minimum wage at Panera Bread trying to graduate high school and move out of my parent's house. Max moved with me to Florida in June to my grandparents house and my grandparents just adored him. Max and I got unexplainably close. he went from being my best friend to my baby, my son.

around December i kinda noticed he wasn't particularly eating or drinking right. but it was weird. he was usually a super flamboyant, crazy bunny who'd run around and kick his legs and jump on the furniture and run in circles. he was crazy. the best. but some days he wouldn't eat at all and isolate himself in his nest behind the couch i'd made for him. other days he'd eat and drink seemingly fine. i thought, ah, what the heck. maybe he's moody. shoot, we all have bad days. and at least he isn't going a full 24hrs without food/drink. that's good. i was taking him to the vet once every 3 weeks for his tooth and nail trim as well as a checkup. keep in mind before i got Max i hadn't the slightest inkling on how to care for a rabbit, so i was blindly expecting the vet to do his necessary checkups.

whenever i would scratch Max in *that* spot, you know, the one he can't reach or the one that feels just right, he'd get super happy and lick. he'd lick my hand, his fur, anything his small little mouth could reach. but mostly his fur. and he was shedding, a lot during this time. but i thought whatever, maybe he's like a cat and it'll just go straight through him.

him not eating was getting worse, so the first week of January i took him to the vet. hundreds of dollars and some x rays later i find out he's got a massive lump in his stomach, and the vet assumes it's a hairball. he says he knew something was wrong with his stomach the second he listened to it, because it was making gurgly noises and it shouldn't have been. i didn't think about this until i got home with Max and his diagnosis of a soon surgery and new diet of pineapple juice to break down the hairball that, isn't that the vet's job?? in the check-up i take him to once every 3 weeks?? to check his stomach?? he's supposed to be a rabbit expert! i didn't know hairballs were a problem for rabbits!

Max goes in for surgery the next week, February 15th at around 9am. the doctor completes a successful surgery, crazy because most rabbits don't survive surgery. but he called me and said as soon as he finished sewing up Max, his heart stopped. after several failed attempts of CPR and resuscitation, he was gone. my baby was gone.

i remember that phone call as clear as day. i can still hear my own gut wretched screams. screaming his name, just saying no, asking God why. my grandmother sobbing beside me. she loved him so much too. i hate my screams. they haunt me, as if they were his own.

a couple weeks later and i learn rabbits get hair balls from overgrooming themselves, and they overgroom themselves due to boredom. at this point i want to shoot myself because i know since December i'd been working extra hours at work for Christmas and because i had plans to go out of the country February-March to visit my long distance boyfriend. so i wasn't home a ton. but i still was for a few hours a day, and Max and i always played. my grandparents are overweight (you could even say obese) so i wasn't counting on them to play with Max. but was he overgrooming himself because of me? was it my fault for not educating myself on rabbits and hairballs? did i kill him?

God, it pains me to even think that. that i effing killed him. did i?? i'm still crying about it. i had to unfollow all the bunny pages on Instagram, facebook, tiktok, i even unjoined this server because they all remind me of him. God, I miss him so much. why did this have to happen? i'm still mad at the vet in the back of my mind for not checking his stomach. still mad because no vets informed me of this, and while i had Max i had been to three different vets!

how do i get past this, knowing my circumstances? anything helps.

[New Bunny Index](https://rabbit.org/care/new-bunny-index.html)  

#Initial investments  
1. They’re very high commitment. 
2. They are very clever, have excellent memories and will remember things for a very long time.  
3. You cannot punish them like a cat/dog or it will harm your bond.  
4. If well taken care of, a rabbit can happily live to be 10 years old or older.  
5. Rabbits love to chew and dig and will chew and dig just about anything. 
6. They need to chew to prevent their teeth from becoming a health hazard.  
7. They will need their claws trimmed regularly to prevent health hazards.  
8. Rabbits are *not* a pet for a child and demand a large amount of attention and responsibility, (**Do not buy a rabbit for your child for Easter**, unless you’ve done your research and are willing to take on 100% of the responsibilities of having one).  

#Housing/Setup  
1. They love to run around, hop and thrive outside of cages, using them at night is fine but just make sure they get a _minimum_ of 3 hours to run and stretch per day.  
2. An exercise pen setup is often cheaper than a cage and gives more room to run around when you can’t let them out. You can buy one for $59 on Walmart.com ([link here](http://www.walmart.com/ip/415185996)), a litterbox for $6 ([link here](http://www.walmart.com/ip/637602463)) and a waterbowl for $5 ([link here](http://www.walmart.com/ip/22210863)) which is less than $80 for a decent bunny setup.   
3. While we are not against outdoor rabbits here, it is highly recommended you keep your rabbit indoors with you, this prevents predators from being able to get to them as well as gives you much better opportunity to bond with your rabbit.
4. If you find it necessary to use a cage because of escaping or other needs I would suggest building your own cage as most of the prefab ones are just crappy design and won’t last the lifetime of the rabbit.
5. A coated metal grate is NOT a wire cage and shouldn’t cause any issues to their feet, you should still provide all rabbits with their own litterbox and other areas to sit/lie down off of the grate.
6. I personally use straw for litter for my litter-boxes and put their hay on top of that, you can use whatever type of litter just avoid using rock/sand based litter as it’s bad for their feet.  

#Diet  
1. They eat 95%+ hay such as Timothy/orchard/meadow hay (/alfalfa if they’re young or elderly) and only 5% or less treats like carrots, apples and bananas.  
2. For a small amount of hay I suggest Oxbow which can be bought at most places ([Chewy link](https://www.chewy.com/dp/123740)) or if you have a proper storage method you can get it for much cheaper by the bale at Tractor Supply Co.
3. Suggested to give pellets daily, 1/4-1/2 cup per 6 pounds of rabbit (so about 1/4 cup daily for a single dwarf rabbit or about 1 cup for a single average sized rabbit).  
4. Recommend high quality food such as Purina, Oxbow, or Sherwood brand.  
5. You can feed a pellet-free diet but just like all animals rabbits require some sodium so if you don’t provide pellets make sure they have access to a mineral lick or other sodium sources.  

###OK food/treats and foods to avoid  
1. Once they’re over the age of 4-6 months they can also have unlimited lettuce and greens, but *never* give iceberg lettuce as it gives really bad gas that can become fatal. ^*^greens ^should ^not ^be ^the ^primary ^diet.  
2. Avoid excessive spinach and kale as they can also give gas, but are perfectly fine in moderation.  
3. The best greens are green leaf lettuce, Bibb lettuce, dark leafed lettuces or locally sourced romaine (store bought romaine has a tendency to get recalled...), also herbs like dill, basil, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage, cilantro and parsley are typical favorites.  
4. I wouldn’t give cabbage because it can cause gas similarly to iceberg lettuce.  
5. Never give human foods (except salad), like bread, diary, cheese, meat or sweets, they will make them very fat and don’t need it and could cause severe GI issues.  
6. They should have unlimited hay at all time, they graze pretty much 24/7. ^*^Hay ^should ^be ^their ^primary ^diet.  
7. Avoid giving treats with yogurt in them as these will make your rabbit very fat and rabbits are not intended to consume dairy past weaning and can cause bad GI issues.  
8. Seeds are ***not*** toxic or *generally* dangerous to rabbits, I would not recommend giving treat sticks with seeds because they’re very high in added sugar and cause indigestion or extreme gas which can become a serious issue.  
9. Seeds like black oil sunflower seeds are safe and actually beneficial to coat health, (if you’re not sure, search the internet for information before you give it to them).  
10. Do not give nuts to rabbits because they do not need the excessive nutrients and can cause pasty or foul poops. Additionally raw nuts are typically poisonous, like almonds, which contain cyanide if not cooked properly.  
11. I recommend treats such as: no sugar added dried apple, banana or carrot and occasionally a Cheerio is also acceptable. Just be mindful of the amount of sugar you are giving them, even with no sugar added fruits.  
12. Corn is not specifically bad or toxic but whole kernel corn can get caught in the GI tract and cause a blockage, further; corn will make them very fat quickly and I would suggest avoiding giving corn or treats with corn/corn meal/corn syrup. (Corn is sometimes evasively labeled as ‘maize’ on packaging).  
    
###Hydration  
1. Water bowls are easier on a rabbit but are not strictly required, I have both bowls and bottles and they use both.  
2. You should clean your water bowl/bottles with either bleach or vinegar at least once a month.  

#Necessity for another bunny/Bonding  
1. They thrive in pairs and love companionship of another bunny, if you cannot provide constant attention it is highly suggested to have more than one rabbit. Think of them like little horses, horses need to have another horse around.  
2. Do not allow non-bonded rabbits to be together unsupervised as they can fight and cause some very serious damage to each other.  
3. Do not put more than one rabbit per cage, if they’re bonded and it’s an open enclosure then you can and they should be fine.  
4. For more information about bonding rabbits, I would suggest checking out the excellent resources on rabbit.org ([link here](https://rabbit.org/faq-bonding-multiple-rabbits/))  

#Spay/Neuter/Responsible Breeding
1. Many people feel strongly about castration as it helps to calm their hormonal rages and also there are studies that say castrated rabbits live longer.  
2. We are not against ***responsible*** *breeding* but it is a huge, huge commitment and you must be willing to take that on and find all the babies forever homes that love them as much as you do - don’t let just anyone have them.  
3. You can wait a while to castrate your rabbit if there are no behavior issues but it’s best to get it done before about 4 years old as that is when cancer risks become an issue and any older it could be too risky.  
4. If you want a rabbit that is already castrated consider a rescue rabbit, there are thousands of rabbits in rescues in need of forever homes, most of which are already castrated and sometimes even in bonded pairs/groups.  
5. If you are experiencing behavioral issues such as humping, marking, peeing or pooping outside the litterbox a castration will help immensely.  
6. If you decide you want to try to responsibly breed you need to keep three main commitments in mind:  
6A. have them as a pet that is also allowed to have babies, they’re not baby factories.  
6B. Make a commitment to keep all your rabbits out of shelters; allow no questions asked returns.  
6C. Make sure they get a forever home with someone that loves them as much as you do; even if it takes more than one try.  

#Chewing/Digging/Enrichment

1. I would recommend untreated wood chew balls or fruit flavored balsa blocks for enrichment.  
2. If you can set up an outdoor pen for your rabbit they would love it and nothing is more satisfying than digging in real dirt, (remember to watch them at all times, also if your area has RHDV around I wouldn’t allow them outside for now).  
3. If letting them outside is not an option there are things called “dig mat, “dig meadow” or “nibble and dig” and they are literally a piece of dirt made for rabbits to satiate their desire to dig.  
4. There are many options for rabbit enrichment and even something so trivial as a cardboard box may be plenty to keep your rabbit happy.  
5. Avoid the “chew toys” that contain seeds and other treats as they are that - treats, despite being advertised as a toy, they are more of a treat.  

#GI stasis and prevention
1. GI stasis is a very serious and commonly fatal condition for rabbits, but can be prevented and treated if caught early.  
2. Watch your rabbit’s dropping at all times, if their poops do not look healthy, are odd shapes, pasty, extremely dark, have not pooped in the last 4 hours or are otherwise concerning it is recommended you take your rabbit to the vet as soon as possible, time is of the essence.  
3. Dark colors in urine (including dark red) is normal for rabbits, watch for specks of blood and only be concerned if you see blood.  
4. Watch your rabbit’s routine and body language, if they don’t eat their favorite food or their pellets you can surely know something is wrong.  
5. If they are laying in an odd position like on their side or acting lethargic you should check them for gas by giving them a gentle belly message and if they do not return to normal soon, take to the vet.  
6. Infant Gas Drops are available immediately in most pharmacies or online ([Walmart link](http://www.walmart.com/ip/10324604)) and are a safe way to relieve gas in your rabbit and cannot be overdosed on, if however, three doses does not return them to normal, take to the vet.  
7. It is always good idea to have emergency food on hand in case of a GI stasis, there is Oxbow Critical Care ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FKACXO/)) and also Sherwood SARx ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019EM0ED2/)).
